Earlier versions of jwma (from 0.9x to 1.x) were covered by a BSD style license, which 
still applies to those files that the program has retained - for instance the files in 
the images directory. A copy of this file is included in the WEB-INF/classes/license 
directory in the file LICENSE.

Starting with version 2.0, the java source code files were completely rewritten and these 
are now covered by the GPL3 license a copy of which is included in the same directory in 
the file GPL.

The licenses of all bundled software including stripes, javamail and jquery are acknowledged.
